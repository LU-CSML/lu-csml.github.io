      <description>Work done in collaboration with Tony Pettitt from QUT Brisbane.
I would like to:
 Introduce the Dirichlet form, which can be thought of as a generalisation of expected squared jumping distance, and show that the spectral gap has a variational representation over Dirichlet forms.
 Introduce the asymptotic variance of a Markov chain, which is the theoretical equivalent of the practical measure of 1/effective sample size, and provide a variational representation of this.</description>
